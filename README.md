# Encryption CLI

A Python utility for securely encrypting files with AES-256 encryption and zlib compression, with integrity verification and progress tracking.

## Features

- Complete CLI integration for encryption, decryption, and compression
- Configurable compression levels through CLI arguments
- Extensive logging and error handling
- Support for multiple file formats
- Progress tracking during operations

## Specifications

- AES-256 CBC mode encryption
- Zlib compression with configurable levels (1-9)
- SHA-256 hash verification for tamper detection

## Installation

```bash
# Requires Python 3.9+
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Secure a File (Encrypt + Compress)

```python
from src.main import secure_file

secure_file(
    "sensitive.docx",
    "your_strong_password",
    compression_level=7  # Optimal balance of speed/size
)
# Creates: sensitive.docx.flc
```

#### CLI Command:

```bash
python src/cli.py encrypt file_path --password yourpassword --compression balanced
```

Available compression levels: none, fast, balanced, max

### Restore a File (Decrypt + Decompress)

```python
from src.main import restore_file

restore_file(
    "sensitive.docx.flc",
    "your_strong_password"
)
# Restores: sensitive.docx
```

#### CLI Command:

```bash
python src/cli.py decrypt file_path --password mypassword
```

Optional arguments:

- `--output`: Specify custom output path

For more example commands and usage scenarios, refer to the `sample.sh` script included in the repository. The script includes examples of:

- Direct file compression with different compression levels
- Progress tracking during compression/decompression
- Various compression configurations
- Basic and advanced usage patterns

## Technical Details

### File Structure (.flc)

```
[1 byte: compression level] +
[32 bytes: SHA-256 hash] +
[zlib compressed data] +
[AES-256 encrypted payload]
```

### Integrity Verification

1. Generates SHA-256 hash of original data
2. Stores hash in file header
3. Verifies hash during restoration

## Testing

Run test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
